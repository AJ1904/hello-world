# hello-world

## Inspiration
The code was created for the MLH (Major League Hacking) challenge, specifically for the beginners week. The challenge required participants to implement a classic 'Hello, World!' program in a language of their choice. 

## What it does
The code generates 'Hello, World!' phrases in multiple languages, showcasing language diversity and implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `taipy` library.

## How we built it
Utilizing Python and leveraging the `taipy` library, we crafted a script that populates a dictionary with 'hello world' phrases in various languages. The GUI allows users to interactively explore these phrases and visualize language distribution based on their initial letters.

## Challenges we ran into
- Integrating the `taipy` library for GUI implementation, given that it was the first attempt using this tool.
- Structuring and organizing the code efficiently to manage language data and GUI elements.
- Handling data manipulation and visualization for an extensive language set.
- Deploying application to Taipy cloud.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully implementing 'Hello, World!' in numerous languages, providing an educational and interactive tool.
- Overcoming the challenges of integrating a new library, `taipy`, and effectively using it for GUI development.
- Creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface for exploring language phrases.

## What we learned
- Familiarization with the `taipy` library for GUI development.
- Enhanced skills in data manipulation and visualization using `pandas` for diverse language sets.
- Problem-solving techniques when handling a large dataset within a graphical interface context.

## What's next for hello-world
- Using translator for any input text, not just 'Hello World!'
